# Heroes Of Pymoli- Panda Challenge

Hello! 
Welcome to my Panda Challenge where you will find the Heroes of Pymoli.

There HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb within the HeroesOfPymoli folder is the final solution. 

There is a Pymoli_test.ipynb within in the folder; that was soley for testing my solutions. Please ignore. 

I welcome detailed feedback to help me grow in this field. 

Thank you for stopping by and have a wonderful day. 

# <b>Observations</b>
<b>1.</b> The first observation that was made was the male to female ratio difference. Out of 576 players; 484 players were men leaving the remaining (81) females/Non-Discolsed. It could be determined by this observation that this is a male dominate game.

<b>2.</b> The second observation ties in with the first. Within the Purchasing Analysis by Gender, there was a total of 780 purchased with Males having the highest purchase count of 652 (84% purchase difference). Though there are only 576 players, it seems that at a minimum, an additional 168 males purchased more than once. For females an additional 32 players purchased more than once. With that being said, it can be seen that the females actually have a higher per person average by $0.40. 
It could be a good experiment for the company to explore making the game more inticing for females to join, to potentially increase sales. 

<b>3.</b> The age demographics show that the top spender via age group would be 20-24. I think it would be a good idea to do a gender analysis on this as well, to which age group the genders were and where it reflects on the total purchase value, to potentially get a better understanding on how the company could increase sales. 

<b>4.</b> My final observation was the "Final Critic" Item being the most popular item sold. With the "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" being a close second but the value is $9.23 difference. It would be a good test to put "Final Critic" on sale to see if it can increase the number of purchases, to help the company increase sales.
